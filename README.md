# User-Management-Bash-Script



Explanation:
Password Policies:

Password Expiry: Passwords expire after 90 days.
Minimum Password Length: Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
Maximum Password Age: Passwords must be changed within 365 days.
Password Expiry Warning: 7 days before the password expires.
Group Creation:

Before adding a user, the script checks if the group exists. If the group doesnâ€™t exist, it will create it using groupadd.
User Creation:

The script prompts the user for the username, password, full name, and group. It then creates the user and applies the password policies using chage.
User Deletion:

The script will prompt you for the username and remove the user with userdel -r (which also removes the user's home directory).
Menu Interface:

The script provides a simple menu that allows the user to choose whether to add a user, delete a user, or exit the script.
Usage:
Make the script executable:

bash

chmod +x user_management.sh
Run the script:

bash

./user_management.sh
Script Behavior:

When you run the script, you'll see a menu with three options:
Add a User: Prompts you for the username, password, full name, and group to add a new user.
Delete a User: Prompts you for the username to delete an existing user.
Exit: Exits the script.
